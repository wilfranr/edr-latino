They are found in Miquella's Haligtree.; Beginning at Haligtree Canopy Site of Grace, head up the branch in front of you and take a left towards the three Oracle Envoys. Immediately after passing the second Oracle Envoy, turn right and jump off the mushroom that leads to another branch containing a large Oracle Envoy. Run past this enemy until you reach a cluster of mushrooms. Jump from here, down to the large branch containing the patrolling giant ants. Sneak past or fight your way through them (if you reset the area and immediately head along through this route, once you jump down onto the large branch, you should only have to deal with one Giant Ant) and head up the branch. This will take you directly to a lone Giant Oracle Envoy.; Alternative route can be taken from Haligtree Town Site of Grace: go back and up the ladder, run up the wide branch, jump down from the third cluster of mushrooms onto the narrow branch to the left and then go left again to the first Envoy. Three timed rolls are needed for this part. Flask of Wondrous Physick with Opaline Hardtear and Opaline Bubbletear combined with Lord's Divine Fortification are a tremendous help. Up the branch with first Giant Oracle Envoy is the second one grouped with a Large Oracle Envoy and two Oracle Envoy's.; Alternative option: From the Haligtree Town Site of Grace, go back and up the ladder, run onto the wide branch and stop before the first two Scarlet Rot Miranda Sprouts (killing them helps). There should be a part of the branch that sticks up slightly right where the first sprout was, with a disc shape facing away from the Giant Oracle Envoy above. Walking into it or casting spells should not move your character from here, so casting spells with an arc and an explosion such as Cannon of Haima while aiming straight up will kill the first Envoy and prevent the stress of making it onto the same branch. Then it is trivial to kill the second Giant Oracle Envoy and its accompanying Large Oracle Envoy."

Ride your horse until the cliff meets the water. The cliffside here should have a more red hue to it than the rest of the rock found in Limgrave. If you’re facing the wall due East you’ll notice a cragged vertical line where one part of the cliff face is protruding from another. Double jump on Torrent while following that line and you should now be riding up the cliff face. Now turn your camera to face Northeast, you’ll notice what appears to be an arrowhead of grey stone forming a flat surface among the red-hued cliff. Jump there, then turn the camera South. While it doesn’t look feasible, sprint jump with torrent towards the protrusion across the before mentioned cragged vertical line. When you land, quickly double jump (facing East) to get on top of the ledge. You’ll notice above you several steps in the cliff face just slightly to the right- climb those. Then, jump due North onto the final platform. You will now be above the cliff and able to drop down to the weapon."

Once you get to the first set of roofs in Nokron, you will see a derelict tower off to the right of the roof ramp. You will need to jump from the ramp to the tower to reach the torch. An ideal position is to jump up onto the square platform, aim diagonally toward the corner of the tower, run and jump (holding sprint as you jump). There is no other way to reach the Ghostflame Torch if you proceed to the lower roof platforms of Nokron. There is no way back up except to start over from the Crater again. Video Location"
